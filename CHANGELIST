Hello, world!

Submitted paper to UIST on HCSS yesterday. Going with HCSS (Hierarchical
Cascading Stylesheets) as the name.

For posterity's sake, the original name was "Lossless Templates", which became
"Data Stylesheets", which became "Hierarchical Stylesheets", which became
"Hierarchical Cascading Stylesheets". 

Starting an empty repository with intent to rewrite the code such that it is
suitable for general-purpose use instead of just a research prototype. (unit
tests, here I come)
